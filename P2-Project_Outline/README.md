## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My friend has a busy air bnb in a great spot in downtown kc. During my conversation with my friend she mentioned that she would like for her guests to take advantage of the great location of the air bnb. The house is located in a great spot with many activities within walking distance, but the guests still drive. She said that she wanted a way to incentive her guests to walk to local attractions nearby. I suggested that she have a webpage that shows attractions in an x mile radius. Furthermore adding local weather to the webpage would be a nice way to let the guests know what to expect from the elements.
